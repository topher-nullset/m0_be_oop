# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
# They were harder but reaching out to Zach and my core has really helped.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
# Staying focused isn't hard at all but taking breaks isn't natural for me and I have to remind myself to do so. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
# I didn't know how much power I could hide inside a custom class but I'm amazed by what I was able to do.
